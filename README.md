# DeliveryApp

## Context

A delivery person wishes to have a mobile application to:

- Manage the points of sale they visit.
- Plan their delivery routes (itineraries).
- Record data from visits and sales.
- Track routes between their GPS position and the points of sale.

---

## Objectives

The goal is to create a Flutter application that allows the delivery person to:

1. Manage their points of sale (add, modify, delete).
2. Plan their delivery route.
3. Record sales and notes after each visit.
4. Visualize itineraries and navigate through planned routes.

---

## Expected Features

### 1. Authentication
- A login page to secure access to the application.

### 2. Management of Points of Sale
The delivery person can manage their points of sale:
- Add a point of sale with:
    - Name of the point of sale.
    - Address.
    - Contact details (name and phone number).
    - Storage capacity.
    - GPS coordinates.
- Modify or delete a point of sale.

### 3. Route Planning
- The delivery person can select the points of sale they plan to visit for a given day.
- The order of visits can be organized by the delivery person.

### 4. Geolocation and Itinerary
- Display all points of sale on an interactive map.
- Show the route between the delivery personâ€™s current GPS position and the selected points of sale in the itinerary.
- The itinerary is downloaded via the OpenRouteService API and saved in the database for offline viewing.

### 5. Sales Tracking
- After each visit, the delivery person records the following data:
    - Quantity sold.
    - Observations or notes.
    - Time of the visit.
